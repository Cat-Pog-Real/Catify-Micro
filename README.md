3. **Connect** both power and ground from the ESP32 to the DAC.  
4. **Install** the [Catify](https://github.com/Cat-Pog-Real/Catify) software.  
5. **Install** Pillow via pip:  
   ```bash
   pip install pillow
   ```
6. **Flash** the device with the firmware.

### Assembly:

1. Make the **cover screw holes slightly larger than 3mm** so the screws can slide in freely.  
2. Insert the **3 M3 30mm screws** through the front of the case.  
3. Place the **ESP32 board (with DAC soldered)** inside the case.  
4. Install the **button** into the designated hole.  
5. Add **nylon washers** on the screws behind the PCB (you may need to trim them to fit).  
6. Add **hex nuts** to hold the PCB in place snugly.  
7. **Plug in the battery** to the ESP32 board.  
8. Place the **battery inside the bottom/back cover** compartment.  
9. Attach the **back cover**.  
10. Finally, secure it with **M3 lock nuts** on the screws sticking out the back.
